# Assignments
This assignment involves building and training a CNN model on both the MNIST and Caltech-101 datasets. The tasks include:

Dataset Preparation:

Load, visualize, and preprocess the MNIST and Caltech-101 datasets.
Normalize pixel values for both datasets.
CNN Architecture:

Construct a CNN with two convolutional layers and two pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer.
Train the model using categorical cross-entropy and the Adam optimizer.
Evaluate Top 1 and Top 5 accuracy on both datasets.
Pooling Variations:

Implement Max Pooling and Average Pooling for the second pooling layer.
Compare the performance using both pooling strategies on the datasets.
Feature Map Visualization:

Visualize feature maps after the first and second convolutional layers.
Analyze how feature maps change with deeper layers and the role of convolutional layers in feature extraction.
